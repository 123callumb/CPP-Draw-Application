Extensions and additional things I did (Wasted time on).
- There's the pen tool, can move the shape around, delete, save/load etc. 
- You can select multiple shapes at once with the move tool by holding shift. Hold shift whilst moving them as well.
- You can control the layers of each shape with the layers tab on the right hand side. Drag and drop over the layer position you want to move the shape to.
- Colour tab is a new window.

There are a few memory leaks, I couldn't find out where they came from in time. I am deleting in most cases, but there's some pointer im not deleting somewhere but I don't know where...

Load before save for a lovely picture.
